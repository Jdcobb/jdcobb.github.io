# Positivity in Algebraic Geometry
![GOS](/images/projects/positivity.jpg "Various illustrations from Positivity in Algebraic Geometry I.")


## Resources
We are reading Positivity in Algebraic Geometry I by Robert Lazarsfeld. The current plan is to cover Chapter 1 (Ample and Nef Bundles) and Chapter 2 (Linear Series) very thoroughly, and then use this foundation to cover some important consequences: the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem and the Kodaira vanishing theorem.

I'm leaving some room to split any readings into two weeks, or to veer in another direction if we would like. I know that Daniel Erman would like to give a lecture. By coincidence, Lazarsfeld will be in town around the middle of the semester.

## Meeting Structure
We will be meeting weekly (details TBD). While reading, write any questions you have and bring them. Each week the speaker will be giving a ~50 minute talk summarizing and motivating the reading that week, preferably picking a few of the many examples to work through in detail. Note that being the speaker does *not* mean you are expected to know everything -- You can have lots of questions too. During the talk, you should ask your questions for everyone to collectively discuss, perhaps saving any "harder" questions for the end.
