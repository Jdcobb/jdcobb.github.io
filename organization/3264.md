## Meeting Structure
While reading, write any questions you have and bring them. Each week the speaker will be giving a ~50 minute talk summarizing and motivating the reading that week, skipping proofs and focusing on how to use the theorems and objects. Note that being the speaker does *not* mean you are expected to know everything -- You can have lots of questions too. During the talk, you should ask your questions for everyone to collectively discuss, perhaps saving any "harder" questions for the end.
