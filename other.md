## Projects
- [arxiva](https://arxiva.org) is a project my friend and I worked on together that ended up winning first place for early stage start ups at the [2021 Transcend Madison Entrepreneurship Competition](https://www.transcenduw.com/_files/ugd/908254_95a84725bcd8466c90ccce4d39c7f0e3.pdf). We wanted to try and add functionality to arxiv. It is built using django, docker, elasticsearch, mysql and is automatically updated via aws.
