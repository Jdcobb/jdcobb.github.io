  description: We utilize a sheaf-theoretic technique to optimally extend vector representations of old entities in knowledge graphs to previously unseen entities. This technique also gives an efficient way of predicting facts about these new entities and compares well to other more complicated state-of-the-art inductive reasoning methods.

  description: Motivated by toric geometry, we lift machinery for understanding syzygies of curves in projective space to the setting of products of projective spaces. Using this machinery, we show an analogue of an influential result of Gruson, Peskine, and Lazarsfeld that gives a bound on the regularity of a possibly singular curve given its degree and the dimension of the ambient projective space.

  description: Any matrix gives rise to an associated family of canonical complexes associated to it, including the Eagon-Northcott and Buchsbaum-Rim. Famously, there is a simple criterion for checking the exactness of these complexes. We give generalization of this criterion for these complexes to be *virtual resolutions*, which are "exact enough" to be relevant to the geometry of toric varieties.

  description: The KdV equation is a prototypical example of an exactly solvable PDE, due in part to its admittance of soliton solutions. This paper examines and classifies the dynamics of quaternion-valued solutions of the noncommutative KdV equation.
