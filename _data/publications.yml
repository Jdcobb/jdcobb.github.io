  description: The regularity of a projective variety tells you how algebraically complicated its syzygies are. I generalize an important theorem about the regularity of curves when they are embedded in products of projective spaces.

  description: Any matrix gives rise to an associated family of canonical complexes associated to it, including the Eagon-Northcott and Buchsbaum-Rim. Famously, there is a simple criterion for checking the exactness of these complexes. We give generalization of this criterion for these complexes to be *virtual resolutions*, which are "exact enough" to be relevant to the geometry of toric varieties.

  description: The KdV equation is a prototypical example of an exactly solvable PDE, due in part to its admittance of soliton solutions. This paper examines and classifies the dynamics of quaternion-valued solutions of the noncommutative KdV equation.
