  abstract: "Understanding the syzygies among the equations defining a projective variety continues to be instrumental in understanding their properties. Starting from polynomials and proceeding with specific examples, the first part of the talk will motivate the existence of virtual syzygies which work for the larger class of toric varieties. We will then focus on recent work addressing a few questions about these analogues, such as: How can we construct (families of) examples? How complicated do they get (at least in the case of curves)?"

- title: "Syzygies and Koszul Cohomology"
  location: UW Madison Graduate Algebraic Geometry Seminar
  city: Madison, WI
  abstract: Early on in the history of algebraic geometry it was recognized that many properties/invariants of projective varieties could be deduced by looking at their hyperplane sections. Starting in the 1950s, this classical picture was gradually refined into general theory by people like Serre and Kodaira — many hard-earned numbers could now be obtained by more brainless methods. I hope to motivate a few ideas in the 1980’s as a continuation of this story beginning from Serre’s vanishing theorem.

- title: "Introduction to Boij-Söderberg Theory"
  location: UW Madison Graduate Algebraic Geometry Seminar
  city: Madison, WI
  url: https://www.math.wisc.edu/wiki/index.php/Graduate_Algebraic_Geometry_Seminar
  notes: /talks/Boij-Söderberg.pdf
  abstract: The main complication to understanding the structure of a module M comes from the lack of a basis. Instead, we have a system of generators with some relations between them, and then relations between those relations, and so on. Hilbert’s insight in 1890 was that by associating free resolutions to M, we can keep track of this data and get a handle on its structure. In 2006, Mats Boij and Jonas Söderberg put out a few striking conjectures (now theorems due to Eisenbud and Schreyer in 2007) that greatly improved our understanding of free resolutions of modules over polynomial rings k[x_1,…,x_n] where k is a field, yielding near immediate proofs to a number of other conjectures. Starting from the definition of a free resolution and proceeding by examples, I will introduce Betti tables and a convex cone they span, the Boij-Söderberg conjectures that completely characterize this cone, and then sketch a surprising duality with the cohomology tables of vector bundles on projective spaces that powers the proof.
