    - Alex Kasman
  description: "Conduct research of noncommutative soliton solutions to the nonabelian n-KdV hierarchy and KP hierarchy focusing on quaternion-valued solutions to the KdV equation."
- title: Summer Data Analyst
  years: Jul 2017-Aug 2017
  company: Tresata
  location: Charlotte, NC
  mentors: 
    - Tim Chartier
  description: "Invited by Chief Analyst Dr. Tim Chartier to represent IGARDS and design efficiently stored graph theory algorithms for the rankability project. Involved rewriting prospective rankability measures (primarily using Apache spark) to fit the memory partitioning schemes of computer clusters, with the ultimate goal of speeding up the computation of large ranking problems.

- title: Student Researcher
  years: Dec 2016-May 2019
  company: Institute on Graph Analytics and Research in Data Science
  location: Charleston, SC
  mentors:
    - Paul Anderson
    - Amy Langville
  description: "Worked with a team dedicated to pursuing fundamental problems in data science. Designed algorithms to calculate suspected indicators of how ”rankable” a dataset is by virtue of its spectral properties. Created scalable approximative solutions that work across distributed systems. Invited by Dr. Tim Chartier of Davidson College to present at Tresata, a big data predictive analytics company based in Charlotte."
