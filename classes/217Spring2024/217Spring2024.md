# MATH 217:  Calculus with Algebra and Trigonometry II (DISC 304 and 305)
![fire calculus picture](/images/projects/calculus1.jpg)

#### **Office Hours:**  10:00-11:00 Wednesdays and Fridays in Math Learning Center (Van Vleck B224)

## Essential Information

The central location for all course-related information (schedule, homework, syllabus, etc) is [Canvas](https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/386389). We have quizzes every Wednesday based on the material of Thursday's lecture -- this is worth 4% of your final grade. All solutions to quizzes and worksheets will be posted to Canvas promptly.

When you have a question, of course feel free to [email me](mailto:{{ site.email }}) but also please consider posting it to [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/lrhy2ci0dld19h) (which you can do anonymously!) so that everyone can benefit from the discussion. It is incredibly likely that someone else is struggling with a similar issue.

## Resources

It is okay if you get confused. Luckily for us, there are many great resources for the modern calculus student. 

- Your fellow classmates should be your primary resource. Post to [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/lrhy2ci0dld19h) as yourself or anonymously to discuss material with the people that are learning it at the same time as you.
- [Paul's Online Notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/calci/calci.aspx) are very clear and have worked out examples and practice problems. His notes are good at getting to the *practical* things you need to know to solve problems.
- [Professor Leonard](https://www.youtube.com/@ProfessorLeonard/playlists) basically taught me all of Calculus 3. He also inspires me to work out. Seriously, check him out.
- [WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) can compute answers to essentially any calculus query that you enter, although the free version will not provide worked out solutions. Fortunately, UW Madison provides [a license to Mathematica](https://software.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/ssl/csl_download.cgi) which properly contains WolframAlpha.
- Feel free to go to the [TA office hours](https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/386389/pages/office-hours-math-217?module_item_id=6831377) of anyone available, not just mine!
- Need some more math help? See the department page for [tutoring and learning options](https://math.wisc.edu/undergraduate/mlc/), such as the math learning center.
